# virtual_holiday

This interactive app allows the user to experience a virtual holiday abroad. Begin by selecting a holiday type and be transported away to a new destination. Everything the user needs to recreate the holiday feeling virtually is included - from the scenery and atmospheric music, to a waiter who offers a snack and tells bad jokes!

## Development

As our time spent on the project progressed and we came up with more creative ideas, we made a variety of changes to the appearance and functionality of the webpage.

Below is the very first appearance of our website. The css had not yet been implemented and our background image was a temporary low quality version. It is very rewarding to compare our beginning steps to our final version just to see how much our webpage has improved!
