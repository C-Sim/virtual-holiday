## User Story

```md
AS A person with limited resources available to go on holiday
I WANT to be able to recreate the holiday feeling from the comfort of my own home
SO THAT I can summon the illusion that I'm on holiday and a feeling of relaxation
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using the virtual holiday app to create a holiday scene
WHEN I select a holiday type
THEN the relevant components related to that holiday type manifest on the page
WHEN I look at the scenery
THEN I am presented with imagery from the holiday destination type
WHEN I listen to the playlist
THEN the music is relevant to the destination type
WHEN I want to set my thermostat to the temperature of the destination
THEN the temperature is displayed for me to match
WHEN I want to feel like I'm enjoying some down time in the destination
THEN a barman will offer me a beverage and a random joke
WHEN I click on the holiday snap button
THEN all of my holiday details will be saved so I can revisit and/or share
```
